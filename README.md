A custom mechanical keyboard design based on FlatFootFox's take on a single-board version of Brian Low's Sofle Choc keyboard, which is itself a redesigned version of the Sofle keyboard by Josef Adamčík. It uses MrZealot's excellent Ergogen engine to layout the design.

I've made two versions so far. One is designed to use Kailh V1 Choc low-profile keyswitches. The other is designed for Cherry MX switches.
